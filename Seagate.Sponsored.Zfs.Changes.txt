    Create zap for root vdev
    
    And add it to the AVZ, this is not backwards compatible with older pools
    due to an assertion in spa_sync() that verifies the number of ZAPs of
    all vdevs matches the number of ZAPs in the AVZ.
    
    Granted, the assertion only applies to #DEBUG builds - still, a feature
    flag is introduced to avoid the assertion, com.klarasystems:vdev_zaps_v2
    
    Notably, this allows to get/set properties on the root vdev:
    
        % zpool set user:prop=value <pool> root-0
    
    Before this commit, it was already possible to get/set properties on
    top-level vdevs with the syntax <type>-<vdev_id> (e.g. mirror-0):
    
        % zpool set user:prop=value <pool> mirror-0
    
    This syntax also applies to the root vdev as it is is of type 'root'
    with a vdev_id of 0, root-0. The keyword 'root' as an alias for
    'root-0'.
    
    The following tests have been added:
    
        - zpool get all properties from root vdev
        - zpool set a property on root vdev
        - verify root vdev ZAP is created

    Configure zed's diagnosis engine with vdev properties
    
    Introduce four new vdev properties:
        checksum_n
        checksum_t
        io_n
        io_t
    
    These properties can be used for configuring the thresholds of zed's
    diagnosis engine and are interpeted as <N> events in T <seconds>.
    
    When this property is set to a non-default value on a top-level vdev,
    those thresholds will also apply to its leaf vdevs. This behavior can be
    overridden by explicitly setting the property on the leaf vdev.
    
    Note that, these properties do not persist across vdev replacement. For
    this reason, it is advisable to set the property on the top-level vdev
    instead of the leaf vdev.
    
    The default values for zed's diagnosis engine (10 events, 600 seconds)
    remains unchanged.

    zpool: do guid-based comparison in is_vdev_cb()
    
    is_vdev_cb() uses string comparison to find a matching vdev and
    will fallback to comparing the guid via a string.  These changes
    drop the string comparison and compare the guids instead.

    Bump checksum error counter before reporting to ZED
    
    The checksum error counter is incremented after reporting to ZED. This
    leads ZED to receiving a checksum error report with 0 checksum errors.
    
    To avoid this, bump the checksum error counter before reporting to ZED.

    Allow to control failfast
    
    Linux defaults to setting "failfast" on BIOs, so that the OS will not
    retry IOs that fail, and instead report the error to ZFS.
    
    In some cases, such as errors reported by the HBA driver, not
    the device itself, we would wish to retry rather than generating
    vdev errors in ZFS. This new property allows that.
    
    This introduces a per vdev option to disable the failfast option.
    This also introduces a global module parameter to define the failfast
    mask value.
